# Flurry

## Contractor site and client management system

### Overview
You are a busy professional contractor.  You install air conditioning equipment, boilers and heating equipment, connect and install generators, or even small appliances.
You are a small or medium-sized business and your skills are highly desirable.  But managing and remembering your past clients is not your top priority.
In the past you managed your client by noting the phone numbers and taking photos of the equipment labels as you installed it (most of the time.)
When a client calls you for service, repair, warranty information, or new job you mostly rely on your memory and documentation kept by the client to recall the supplier and model of your installed equipment.
Flurry is here to help.  This client and equipment management makes a short job of maintaining all your data with an easy mobile interface.  Just snap a photo of the equipment label and the system automatically creates a client record including address of installation, type of equipment, and dates.  It also allows you to use quickly add additional details such as supplier and client details. 
When a client calls, you will have all the details at your finger tips.  You can also connect to a platinum package that automatically contact your client for annual service reminders and equipment replacement when the time comes.
